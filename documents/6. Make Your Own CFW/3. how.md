# How to Develop

The majority of your changes will probably be in the /anki folder, which is built from diode-os-victor.

## Set up your dev environment

You should have two folders: diode-os-victor and diode-os.

Do NOT just make all of your changes in diode-os/anki/victor, despite it being the same repo. `diode-os-victor` can be built standalone, and deployed to a robot with `rsync`. These builds should not end up in a Yocto environment.
