# purplOS

purplOS is created by [froggitti](https://github.com/froggitti) and is maintained at [purpl-org/purplOS](https://github.com/purpl-org/purplOS).

purplOS is regular Vector firmware with Vector's personality, but has a purple theme, eye scanlines, and firmware 1.6.0.3331 sounds. It is meant to be a more vibrant version of Vector's default personality.

purplOS is based off of [wire-os](https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os-victor).

purplOS is available at [froggitti's Dev Vector web setup](https://devsetup.froggitti.net).
